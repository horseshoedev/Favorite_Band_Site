          <p>Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. They achieved international acclaim with
            their
            progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation,
            extended
            compositions, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential
            groups
            in popular music history.</p>

          <p class="band-info"> Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on
            drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity
            performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership
            released
            two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and
            vocalist
            David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters
            became the primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side
            of
            the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The
            Dark
            Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.</p>

          <p class="band-info">Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985.
            Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, joined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums—A
            Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured through 1994. In 2005, after nearly
            two
            decades of enmity, Gilmour, Wright, Mason and Waters reunited as part of the global awareness event Live 8;
            Gilmour and Waters stated they had no further plans to reunite the band. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in
            2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based
            almost
            entirely on unreleased material from The Division Bell recording sessions.</p>

          <p class="band-info">Pink Floyd were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK
            Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide.</p>
