        <p class="lyrics">Hello,
          Is there anybody in there?
          Just nod if you can hear me.
          Is there anyone at home?

          Come on now
          I hear you're feeling down
          Well, I can ease your pain
          And get you on your feet again

          Relax
          I'll need some information first
          Just the basic facts
          Can you show me where it hurts?

          There is no pain, you are receding
          A distant ship smoke on the horizon
          You are only coming through in waves
          Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
          When I was a child I had a fever
          My hands felt just like two balloons
          Now I've got that feeling once again
          I can't explain, you would not understand
          This is not how I am
          I have become comfortably numb

          I have become comfortably numb

          O.K.
          Just a little pin prick
          There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
          But you may feel a little sick

          Can you stand up?
          I do believe it's working, good
          That'll keep you going through the show
          Come on, it's time to go.

          There is no pain you are receding
          A distant ship smoke on the horizon
          You are only coming through in waves
          Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
          When I was a child
          I caught a fleeting glimpse
          Out of the corner of my eye
          I turned to look but it was gone
          I cannot put my finger on it now
          The child is grown
          The dream is gone
          I have become comfortably numb.</p>

        <p class="lyrics">Ticking away the moments
          That make up a dull day
          Fritter and waste the hours
          In an off-hand way

          Kicking around on a piece of ground
          In your home town
          Waiting for someone or something
          To show you the way

          Tired of lying in the sunshine
          Staying home to watch the rain
          You are young and life is long
          And there is time to kill today

          And then the one day you find
          Ten years have got behind you
          No one told you when to run
          You missed the starting gun

          And you run and you run
          To catch up with the sun
          But it's sinking

          Racing around
          To come up behind you again

          The sun is the same
          In a relative way
          But you're older

          Shorter of breath
          And one day closer to death

          Every year is getting shorter
          Never seem to find the time

          Plans that either come to naught
          Or half a page of scribbled lines

          Hanging on in quiet desperation
          Is the English way

          The time is gone
          The song is over
          Thought I'd something more to say

          Home
          Home again
          I like to be here
          When I can

          When I come home
          Cold and tired
          It's good to warm my bones
          Beside the fire

          Far away
          Across the field
          Tolling on the iron bell
          Calls the faithful to their knees
          To hear the softly spoken magic spell...</p>

        <p class="lyrics">Money, get away.
          Get a good job with good pay and you're okay.
          Money, it's a gas.
          Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
          New car, caviar, four star daydream,
          Think I'll buy me a football team.

          Money, get back.
          I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
          Money, it's a hit.
          Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
          I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
          And I think I need a Lear jet.

          Money, it's a crime.
          Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
          Money, so they say
          Is the root of all evil today.
          But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
          giving none away.

          "HuHuh! I was in the right!"
          "Yes, absolutely in the right!"
          "I certainly was in the right!"
          "You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a
          bruising!"
          "Yeah!"
          "Why does anyone do anything?"
          "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
          "I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking
          why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
          screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely.
          It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out"</p>
